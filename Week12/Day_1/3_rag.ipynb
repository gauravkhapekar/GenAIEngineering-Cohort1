Wait until the chicken is cooked, and then add the kaffir lime leaves and bird’s eye chilies. Remove the pot from heat and add lime juice. 3. Garnish with coriander leaves. Tips: • Keep the heat low throughout the cooking process. High heat will make the oil in the coconut milk separate and rise to the top. • If you’re using mature galangal, reduce the amount. • Lime juice becomes more aromatic when it is added after the pot is removed from heat. • Reduce amount of chilies for a milder taste. { }Tom Kha Gai Chicken and Galangal in Coconut Milk Soup T H A I S E L E C T C O O K B O O K | 0 7 30 Min', 'name': 'ThaiRecipes', 'meta_data': {'page': 5, 'chunk': 1, 'chunk_size': 1275}}], time=0.9091)], add_messages=None, history=None, reasoning_steps=None, reasoning_messages=None), created_at=1752818193)"
